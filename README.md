# ArsenalF
Arsenal is a modern, responsive personal portfolio website built with React and Strapi CMS that showcases professional work experience and skills through a dynamic, content-managed interface. The application features an intelligent navigation system with collapsible dropdown menus powered by Material-UI components and material-ui-popup-state for seamless user interactions.

The frontend is built as a React single-page application utilizing hooks like useState and useEffect for state management, while the backend leverages Strapi as a headless CMS to enable easy content updates without code modifications. The styling architecture uses SASS/SCSS with CSS modules to ensure component-scoped styling and maintainable design patterns.

The infrastructure includes an Nginx reverse proxy configuration with SSL/HTTPS support for secure production deployment. All navigation and work experience data is API-driven, allowing for real-time content updates through the Strapi admin interface. The responsive design ensures optimal viewing across all device types, with collapsible navigation elements that adapt to different screen sizes.

The project follows modern development practices with a clean separation between frontend presentation and backend content management, making it an ideal solution for professionals who want to maintain an up-to-date portfolio without technical overhead. The Docker-ready configuration and automated build scripts streamline both development and deployment workflows.
